This is file that will not match with another one called match2.txt. Now this will have a few lines 
but it should not be exactly matching with the other. I recall there was some extension in vs-code
where we could generate "lorem ipsums" of any size. Maybe it is a good extension to create this 
file.
Manually writing such file is also not bad if it is just about a few lines only.
Starting another paragraph with some connected but slightly different view of the same idea. It is 
about how many lines to write. Currently I am on line no. 6 but I guess going 2 digits is what I am 
aiming for. Having files total lines in 2 digits will test the code with a reasonable line variety 
I guess.
It would be better to also have some bullet points and some punctuations like comma, colon, dash 
etc. Let's start with some bullet points:
  1. I had some commas
  2. I also had one dash in vs-code before. Now I have two!
  3. Colon was used to start this list.
Nice file so far. Also reached two-digits line no. with even knowing about it. This is cool.
